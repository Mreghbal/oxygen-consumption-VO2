## Introduction
Oxygen consumption (VO2) is a measure of the amount of oxygen utilized by the body during physical activity. It is an important parameter in exercise physiology as it provides insights into an individual's aerobic capacity and energy expenditure. This Python script allows you to calculate the estimated VO2 based on weight, age, and gender.

## Usage
### Requirements
To run this script, you need to have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.0 or above)

### Running the Script
Follow these steps to run the script:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the `calculate_vo2.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the following command to execute the script:
   ```
   python calculate_vo2.py
   ```
5. Enter the requested information when prompted (weight, age, and gender).
6. The script will calculate the VO2 value and display it on the console.

## Explanation
### What is2?
VO2, or oxygen consumption, refers to the amount of oxygen that an individual consumes during physical activity. It is a measure of the body's ability to take in and utilize oxygen to produce energy. VO2 is commonly expressed in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min) and is used as an indicator of aerobic fitness.

### Applications of2
VO2 is widely used in various fields, including:

1. **Exercise Physiology**:2 is a key parameter in assessing an individual's aerobic capacity and endurance. It helps determine an individual's fitness level and can be used to design personalized exercise programs.
2. **Sports Science**: VO2 is used to evaluate athletes' performance and monitor their training progress. It provides insights into an athlete's cardiovascular fitness and helps optimize training regimens.
3. **Clinical Settings VO2 testing is used in medical settings to assess patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary conditions. It helps diagnose and monitor conditions such as heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma.

## Step-by-Step Guide
Follow these steps to run and use the script:

### 1. Installation
Before running the script, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Running the Script
To calculate the VO2 using the provided script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the `calculate_vo2.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located using the `cd` command.
4. Run the following command to execute the script:
   ```
   python calculate_vo2.py
   ```
5. Enter the requested information when prompted:
   - **Weight**: Enter your weight in kilograms.
   - **Age**: Enter your age in years.
   - **Gender**: Enter your gender as either "Male" or "Female".
6. The script will calculate the VO2 value based on the provided inputs and display it on the console.
