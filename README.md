# oxygen-consumption-VO2
Here's a sample Python code to calculate oxygen consumption (VO2) in actual conditions
In this code, we define a function called calculate_vo2 that takes inputs such as weight (in kilograms), age, and gender as parameters. The function calculates the VO2 based on the provided parameters by applying the appropriate constants for males and females.

The VO2 value is then adjusted based on age using a standard formula. Finally, the adjusted VO2 value is returned by the function.

To test the function, the code prompts the user to enter weight, age, and gender, and then calls the calculate_vo2 function with the provided inputs. The calculated VO2 value is then printed to the console.

Please note that this code assumes the input values are valid, so you may need to add additional error handling or validations as per your specific requirements.
